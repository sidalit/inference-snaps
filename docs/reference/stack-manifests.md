# Stack manifests

Each stack is accompanied by a manifest file outlining the stack’s components 
and configurations. The manifest also describes the stack’s system requirements. 
It is required during the selection process in order to pick the most 
{spellexception}`optimized` stack for the host machine.

The stack manifest should include the following attributes:

## `name`  
A unique name for the stack.   

## `description`   
The description of the stack  

## `vendor`   
The name of the responsible {spellexception}`organization`  

## `grade`  
Indicates the stability and compliance of the stack. Only stable stacks 
get auto selected. (supported values: `stable` and `devel`)  

## `devices`  
Lists of required computing devices. It’s possible to indicate if more than one
device is required, or if there are multiple options, using the `any` and `all`
keywords. For example, a stack requiring a generic CPU, combined with either an
Nvidia GPU with compute capability 7.0 or an AMD GPU with 8GB vRAM should list 
the CPU under `all` and GPUs under `any`.  
  - `type` - type of the device (cpu, gpu, npu, nil)  
  - Remaining field types depend on the type. See other 
  {ref}`device-specific properties <device-specific-fields>` below.  
  
## `memory`   
Required system memory to load the model. Memory capacities should be given 
either in gigabytes or megabytes, with **G** or **M** as suffixes.  

## `disk-space`   
The total size of stack components plus runtime additions. Disk capacities 
should be given either in gigabytes or megabytes, with **G** or **M** as 
suffixes.  

## `components`  
List of snap components required by the stack  

## `configurations`  
Default snap configurations  
  - `engine` - name of engine snap component (mandatory)  
  - `model` - one of:  
    * Name of model snap component  
    * Path to local directory or file containing the model  
    * nil \- indicates that a separate model is not needed, i.e., when one is 
    already embedded in the engine (e.g. [llamafile](https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile))

(device-specific-fields)=
## Device-specific fields
Device entries may also have the following device-specific fields:  

### CPUs
`architectures`: CPU architecture in Debian nomenclature (amd64, arm64). This 
field is  mandatory. The remaining fields are architecture specific.

- amd64:  
  * `manufacturer-id` - reported by `CPUID` instruction  
  * `flags` - list of required CPU flags  
  * `family-id` - not used   
* arm64:  
  * `implementer-id` - from Main ID register  
  * `part-number` - from Main ID register  
  * `features` - not used

(pci-peripherals)=
### PCI peripherals

* `bus`: `pci`  
* `vendor-id` - PCI vendor ID hex number.
* `device-id` - PCI device ID hex number  
* `device-class` - not used  
* `subvendor-id` - not used  
* `subdevice-id` - not used  
* `programming-interface` - not used

### GPUs

* `bus` - the bus or protocol used by the device (supported values: `pci`, default: `pci`)  
* `vram` - minimum required Video RAM  
* `compute-capability` - applicable to NVIDIA (vendor-id `0x10de`) only. A list 
of MAJOR.MINOR version strings prefixed with a comparison operator (==, \<=, \>=, \>, \<[^1]). 
MAJOR and MINOR must both be integers.

When bus is set to PCI, this object inherits all {ref}`PCI peripheral <pci-peripherals>` fields. 

### NPUs

* `bus` - the bus or protocol used by the device (supported values: `pci`, default: `pci`)

When bus is set to PCI, this object inherits all {ref}`PCI peripheral <pci-peripherals>` fields.

[^1]:  The comparison operators used for Compute Capability are based on 
[PEP](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/#version-specifiers) 
and [Snapcraft’s Python plugin](https://snapcraft.io/docs/python-plugin). 
When compared to [npm’s semantic versioning](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-semantic-versioning) 
and [Debian package’s Depend syntax](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html), 
all operators except the equal operator match.
